### ü™ß Introduction and prerequisites {#introduction-and-prerequisites}

Brewing kombucha is very simple, yet it requires some basic knowledge and some good equipment to
work with.

#### üõ† [Equipment](/equipment) {#equipment}

In a very minimal set up you will need:

-   A big glas [container](/equipment#container)
-   A [SCOBY](/equipment#scoby)
-   1 cup (~ 250mL) of kombucha
-   [Bottles](/equipment#bottles) for storing kombucha
-   [Something to cover the container](/equipment#cover) (cloth, coffee filter...)
-   A rubber band
-   Black tea
-   Sugar
-   Water

Optionally you could use these tools for working more comfortably:

-   A funnel
-   A fine mesh food strainer
-   A scale for weighting the sugar
-   A container for mixing tea and sugar
-   A whisk

#### üí° Some general advices {#general-advices}

-   Always work in a very clean environment

    -   Avoid dust
    -   Avoid sources of mold

-   Only use organic ingredients

    -   As kombucha is kind of a living organism, it is best to feed it exclusively with organic
        products. If you're not convinced, try both and see the difference in taste and feeling.

-   Use clean drinking water

    -   If the water from you sink isn't clean (if it contains chlorine or other nasty things) it
        might disturb the SCOBY. Try to find a filter or another source of clean drinking water.

-   Chose a good spot for your fermentation

    -   No direct sun-light
    -   The air must circulate normally (avoid putting it inside of cupboard)
    -   Not too cold (room temperature is perfect)
    -   Not too warm

### ü•£ Start a new brewing cycle {#start}

:::info

These instructions are for a 3L [container](/equipment#container), if you are using a container of a
different size, make the required adjustments to the quantities.

:::

1.  Prepare an empty (and clean) [container](/equipment#container) with

    -   a **[SCOBY](/equipment#scoby)**
    -   1 cup (~ 250mL) of fermented **kombucha** (‚ö†Ô∏è unflavored!)
        -   The kombucha that is required here is for the SCOBY: it needs to have a minimal sense of
            "home feeling" so that the fermentation can start.
        -   1 cup is the minimum, if there is a bit more than that it's totally fine

2.  Make **1L** of black tea

    -   Use something like 3 to 4 bags of tea per Liter. Basically one bag per cup.
    -   Other teas (like green tea) are also possible to use, but it is advised to start with black
        tea as it is the easiest. <br/>‚ö†Ô∏è**Kombucha needs theine**.

3.  Let the tea steep for a good while (at least 20 minutes)

    -   Cold brewed teas work a well. Then obviously you will need to let it steep for a longer
        period.

4.  Wait that the tea is at room temperature, or do something to cool it down quickly (ice bath).

5.  Strain the tea

6.  Add **80g** of sugar (per Liter)

    -   Any sugar will do
    -   Best is to use organic cane sugar but any source of real sugar will work even syrup, just
        avoid fake sugar like Stevia in the first fermentation.

    <br/>

    :::caution warning

    Do not use anything else than sugar to add the sweetness. The SCOBY feeds on the sugar and it
    cannot feed on anything else.

    :::

    :::tip (Almost) no more sugar left at the end!

    After the fermentation there will be **way less sugar** (and less theine too) left in the
    kombucha. So you are safe to drink it even if you want to avoid sugar in your diet.

    The more you wait (the longer you allow the kombucha to ferment) the less sugar and theine will
    be present in the final beverage.

    :::

    <br/>

7.  Mix the sugar and the tea

    -   Use a whisk to mix the sugar into the tea and to dilute it.
    -   If you have multiples batches to prepare, it is better to mix the sugar and the tea in a
        different container to make sure that you have exactly 1L of tea and 80g of sugar.
    -   It is also possible to mix the sugar and the tea while the tea is still hot.

8.  Pour the mixed sugar and tea into the fermentation container

9.  Fill the rest of the container with **water**
    -   Most containers have a curved border at the top. Leave the curved part empty so that the
        SCOBY (usually floating on at the top of the liquid) can fill out the full width of the
        container while it is fermenting

### üßòüèª Fermentation {#fermentation-1}

The fermentation process is the most simple one, it just requires a little bit of patience.

1. Cover the container where you have prepared your brewing mixture. See
   [this page](/equipment#cover) for detailed advice.

    - To cover the container use a cloth, coffee filter or anything that prevents dust or insects to
      enter into the container while it is fermenting. The insets are attracted by CO2 produced by
      the fermentation. The risk of bacteria contamination is low because of the acidity of the
      solution. Covering the container will also reduce the (relatively low) risk of getting mold
      inside.

2. Let the kombucha ferment for 7 days.

    - Chose a good spot for the fermentation process (see [advices above](/#general-advices)).
    - The fermentation process usually takes around 7 days. Depending on the room temperature and
      other influencing factors it might take longer or be faster. So generally speaking it can take
      from 6 to 10 days.
    - You can taste your kombucha from time to time to check if the fermentation is over or not.
    - The fermentation tends to be faster in warmer environments.

3. Generally speaking the fermentation process should not be disturbed or your SCOBY pellicle will
   not look nice. So, unless it is really necessary, just leave it alone for the 7 days to come.

4. Sometimes the fermentation produces a lot of gas. When that happens, the SCOBY might get lifted
   into the air by a big bubble of gas. It is god to pop out that bubble to let the SCOBY touch the
   liquid. So if necessary release that bubble once or twice a day. Use a clean spoon to push down
   the SCOBY into the liquid.

### üç∫ Enjoy your fresh kombucha {#enjoy}

Now that your kombucha has fermented, you can start a new cycle.

1. Take out the SCOBY from the container
2. Stir the liquid inside the container with a whisk

    - This is optional but still good to do: during the fermentation, some yeast will accumulate at
      the bottom of the container. This yeast is responsible for carbonation in the
      [2nd Fermentation](/2nd-fermentation) and therefore you want it to be evenly distributed in
      the different bottles used for storage or 2nd fermentation.

3. Pour out the fermented kombucha into [bottles](/equipment#bottles) to store it

    - To stop (or better said _slow down_) the fermentation, put the bottles into your fridge or a
      cold spot.

4. Put 1 cup of kombucha and the SCOBY aside (for the next cycle)

    - No need to wash the SCOBY if it looks dirty, you just might disturb its natural equilibrium.

5. Clean the container

    - Usually no soap is required
    - If you need soap, make sure that the container is very well rinsed before reusing it.

6. Start a new cycle.
