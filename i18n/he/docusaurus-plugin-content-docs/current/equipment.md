## כלי {#container}

The main container is used for the first fermentation.

How to chose a good container:

-   Big enough (more than 2L). There no container that is too big!
-   Material: glas or ceramic, but preferably glas, so that you can see what's happening inside!
-   A big enough opening on the top

:::tip

**Use a jar that has tap.** This makes it easier to taste the kombucha to see if it is ready or
needs more fermentation.

## SCOBY {#scoby}

:::note What is a SCOBY?...

SCOBY is the commonly used acronym for "Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast". <br/>
**[Learn more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCOBY).**

:::

To get a SCOBY, best is to find someone that you know who could give you one.

Else you can very easily find one to buy online for a fair price.

:::tip SCOBYs for everyone! 🎁

Once you started your own Kombucha brewing, your SCOBY will grow and you can either increase your
brewing quantity or give away pieces of your SCOBY to friends and family!

To take of a piece of a SCOBY that _grew fat_ you just need to gently peel of a layer.

If giving it away don't forget to give also roughly one cup of already fermented kombucha so that
the SCOBY stays safe and so that the person can easily start his brewing.

Use **only glas** bottles!

do the 2nd Fermentation)

## כיסוי הכלי {#cover}

While doing the first fermentation, the [container](/equipment#container) needs to be protected from
dust, insects, mold and foreign bacteria...

Also the fermentation process need to _breath_ so it is not good to completely close the container
in wich the first fermentation is happening. Not allowing sufficient airflow causes higher levels of
alcohol in the kombucha. And closing the container completely will prevent the kombucha from
fermenting properly.

Options for covering the container:

-   A cloth (tight-weave is better, else small things might get through!)
-   A paper filter (big coffee filters work well) <br/>**=> this is most likely the best option** ✅

To avoid:

-   Things that are not letting enough air flow through
-   Textiles that might drop their own dust into the kombucha

Make sure that what you use stays clean and dry.
